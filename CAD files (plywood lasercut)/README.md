# Laser cutting layouts

The design is authored in AutoCAD - the original intent was to prepare the layouts in such way that they would fit into 60x30cm workspace.

Clock is assembled from several layers using M3 bolts. Individual LED strips are attached to aluminum planks to help dissipating heat and held together using nylon zip ties. Wires are fed through internal channels.

The thickness of plywood can be 4 or 5mm or even thicker - it doesn't matter. 

The diffusors are best cut from matte acrylic. For best results add some styrofoam under the acrylic to diffuse light from individual Neopixels even more.
